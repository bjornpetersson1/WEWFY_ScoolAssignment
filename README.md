# WhatEverWorksForYou  
With all the workout-apps out there i felt that all of the ones i've tried had the wrong focus.  
More than not the focus was on numbers (speed, weight, distance etc.) and not how you experienced the workout.  
By listening to your body more than chasing numbers i believe is a more healthy way of working out.  
My main workout is long distance running and therefore WEWFY is built with running in mind.  
  
    
## The Idea
Track your runs based on your perceived effort and experience.  
By this you can make your own conclusion of whatever works for you.
